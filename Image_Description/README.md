Report: Image Description Web Application

Objective

Develop a web application where users upload an image and receive a descriptive text. The project uses PyTorch, Flask, and Blik for efficient image-to-text processing and delivery.

Key Components

Backend

Frameworks & Models: Utilizes PyTorch for model inference and Blik for optimized pre-trained models.

API Development: Flask is employed to create a REST API for image uploads and description generation.

Deployment: The application can be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or GCP, or run locally for testing.

Frontend

Design: A minimalistic interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures a seamless user experience.

Functionality: Users can upload images, and the app displays the text description in real time.

Evaluation Criteria

Code Quality: Maintain clean, well-documented, and modular code.

Functionality: Deliver accurate and fast image descriptions with a simple, intuitive interface.

Deployment: Ensure robust deployment with clear instructions for usage.

Innovation: Explore added features like multilingual descriptions or performance optimizations.

Conclusion

This project highlights expertise in integrating PyTorch, Flask, and Blik for real-world applications. It demonstrates full-stack capabilities and the ability to create user-friendly AI-driven solutions.
