The above example demonstrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for image generation, which is a key 
technique in Generative AI. The model learns the underlying distribution of input images (in this 
case, MNIST handwritten digits) and generates new images by sampling from the latent space. 
This falls under generative models in AI, which is part of the broader field of image processing
when applied to images.

Image Processing: This involves manipulation, enhancement, or transformation of images. In this case,
the VAE is used for generating new images from learned patterns, which is related to image 
generation.

Generative AI: This refers to models that can generate new data (e.g., images, text, music).
The VAE in this example is a generative model because it can create new images that resemble those 
in the training dataset.

So, yes, the above example is a generative AI-based image processing task, specifically designed for 
image generation using a deep learning model (VAE).

Key Concepts in the Example:
Latent Space: The VAE learns a compact representation of input images (e.g., MNIST digits) in a 
lower-dimensional latent space.
Generation of New Images: The decoder part of the VAE can generate new images by sampling from this 
learned latent space.
If you are looking for more advanced or specific image processing examples in Generative AI, such as 
working with real-world image data (e.g., generating faces, landscape images, etc.), this concept
can be expanded using more complex models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or StyleGAN 
for better quality image generation.
